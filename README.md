# voxbox
A voxel engine based off of the [Gigavoxels paper](http://maverick.inria.fr/Publications/2011/Cra11/CCrassinThesis_EN_Web.pdf).

I previously attempted this with my [goxels](https://github.com/dylanswiggett/goxels) project, but Go was the wrong language choice!

## Requirements

Opengl 4.3 or later.
